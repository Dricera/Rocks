The infinity shows up:
* Method definition
* Exception messages (though not in the member identifier description...?)
* Expectations extension methods

Though I'm guessing that I fix this once, and that should handle it everywhere.

Looks like I'm going to have to handle all the "special" values on primitive types, compare to them, and return the "literal code" value.
