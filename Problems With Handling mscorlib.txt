Handling internal abstract members. Needed to create a scheme for InternalsVisibleTo and "well-known" assembly names.

Lots of mistakes in generating the right type with generic values.

Handling unsafe members with pointer types. Had to create IsUnsafeToMock() extension methods.

Need to create the right "name" for the left-hand side of the delegate name to include generic values (similar to creating the file name - "RocksObjectSecurityT")

For any overridden member, if the base type or method is marked with [ObsoleteAttribute], set a "RequiresObsoleteSuppression" flag. When making the class, surround the class with "#pragma warning disable/restore CS0618"

Looks like I gen'd a delete for an internal virtual method where the method doesn't actually exist (correctly).

For some reason, not handling the constraint could be "where T : struct"

Constructors needed an unsafe check as well.

Down to 572....

Obsolete needed another warning/restore on CS0672

Down to 562...

Ignore the Delegate type

Down to 555...

Problem where I'm not looking at all of the methods across the base type AND its base types. This may only matter for interfaces. Making GetMockableXYZ() extension methods (need tests) to get those lists.

Down to 462...

Have to handle events correctly, in terms of if they're virtual or not.

Down to 460...

Wasn't handling arguments with [In, Out] on them correctly.

Down to 459...

Wasn't handling the case where a sub-interface would "new" a method definition, like ITypeInfo and ITypeInfo2's GetNames(). I only needed 1 implementation in that case.

Down to 408...

2 problems
* I think I need to mock 2 methods...when all I really need to do is implement 1 method. ITypeInfo2 and ITypeInfo are a mess :)
* I still don't get the "string[]" array thing right with parameters that seem to have [Out] but not [In]

To make the current member override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new keyword.
