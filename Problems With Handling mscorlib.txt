Handling internal abstract members. Needed to create a scheme for InternalsVisibleTo and "well-known" assembly names.

Lots of mistakes in generating the right type with generic values.

Handling unsafe members with pointer types. Had to create IsUnsafeToMock() extension methods.

Need to create the right "name" for the left-hand side of the delegate name to include generic values (similar to creating the file name - "RocksObjectSecurityT")

For any overridden member, if the base type or method is marked with [ObsoleteAttribute], set a "RequiresObsoleteSuppression" flag. When making the class, surround the class with "#pragma warning disable/restore CS0618"

Looks like I gen'd a delete for an internal virtual method where the method doesn't actually exist (correctly).

For some reason, not handling the constraint could be "where T : struct"


TODO:
C:\CodeProjects\Rocks\Rocks.Tests\bin\Debug\System\Rock_AppDomain.cs(149,24): warning CS0114: 'Rock_AppDomain.Equals(object)' hides inherited member 'object.Equals(object)'. To make the current member override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new keyword.

Object members like "ToString" and "GetHashCode" are not getting "override"


C:\CodeProjects\Rocks\Rocks.Tests\bin\Debug\System\RockMulticastDelegate.cs(18,30): error CS0115: 'RockMulticastDelegate.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo, StreamingContext)': no suitable method found to override

Not sure what's going on here. The base method is "public override". Should be able to override this....right?


C:\CodeProjects\Rocks\Rocks.Tests\bin\Debug\System\Collections\Generic\RockIListT.cs(10,40): error CS0535: 'RockIList<T>' does not implement interface member 'ICollection<T>.IsReadOnly'

Problem where I'm not looking at all of the methods across the base type AND its base types. This may only matter for interfaces.
