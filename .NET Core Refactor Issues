* I'm throwing .GetTypeInfo() everywhere, should refactor to get it only once per scope
* I have NO tests around IListOfCustomAttributeDataExtensions.GetAttributes() - ugh!
* Why does the .NET Core projects insist on generating the AssemblyInfo attributes?
* Delegate.CreateDelegate is not available in .NET Core. Should revisit to see if there's a workaround.
