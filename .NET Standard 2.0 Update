.NET Standard 2.0 Update

* Need to address these: #if !NETCOREAPP1_1

* Rocks.Tests.NETFramework, Rocks.Task, Rocks.Task.Tests needs to be updated for new .csproj format

* LangVersion should be "latest"

* Still not happy with assembly resolving/loading in Compiler.cs :(

* ArrayPool<T> has Return() with optional clearArray that is "false", but I'm generating "False". The hell?!

ADDRESSED

* NetDataContractSerializer isn't in .NET Standard 2.0
Oh well! Gone.

* ArgIterator doesn't exist...do we really care?
Nope, removing it.
